## FAQ

### What inspired this?
Well I've been fascinated by MTG Arena for quite sometime and was asked to a bit of design on a similar mock up. Once I started going through the design, I thought to myself _why not continue this and see where it goes?_. So here's to a start on the project! Still doing my RenPy work on the side though since I'm finding Python to be a fun language to tinker around with.

### What is in scope for the next 6 months?
- Familiarization with functional components in react
- Re-learning MongoDB, ExpressJS, and NodeJS
- Deployment of iteration one of the project

- Animation for drawing cards from the deck

### How often will this repo be updated?
